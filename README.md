# Blockchain-Based Specialized Handcrafted Furniture Authentication (BSHFA)

## Overview

The Blockchain-Based Specialized Handcrafted Furniture Authentication (BSHFA) platform provides a decentralized solution for verifying, documenting, and tracking handcrafted furniture pieces. By leveraging blockchain technology, BSHFA creates an immutable record of furniture authenticity, craftsmanship, material sourcing, and ownership history, addressing provenance concerns and establishing trust in the artisanal furniture marketplace.

## Core Components

### Artisan Verification Contract
Validates legitimate furniture makers through a secure verification process that documents their credentials, workshop information, crafting techniques, and portfolio history. Creates trusted artisan profiles that establish the foundation for authentic furniture authentication.

### Design Registration Contract
Records comprehensive details of original furniture pieces including design specifications, dimensions, construction methods, finishing techniques, and distinguishing characteristics. Each piece receives a unique identifier on the blockchain linked to its complete digital profile.

### Material Sourcing Contract
Tracks the origin and quality of woods and other components used in furniture creation, documenting species, age, geographic origin, sustainability certifications, and handling methods. Creates a transparent record of material authenticity and responsible sourcing.

### Provenance Contract
Documents the complete chain of custody for each furniture piece from maker to current owner, recording transfer dates, locations, and conditions. Establishes an unalterable timeline of the furniture's journey while maintaining appropriate privacy options.
